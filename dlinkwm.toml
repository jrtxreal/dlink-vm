# DlinkWM Configuration File
# This file can be modified to dynamically change entry functions without restarting

# Entry Functions Configuration
# Define specific entry functions for different WASM files
# Key: WASM file path (relative or absolute)
# Value: List of entry functions to try for this specific file
# The functions are tried in the order they appear in the list

[entry_functions]
# Example configuration for wasm_test.wasm
# Tries to call dlinkwm_print_hello_wasm first, then dlinkwm_test_host_methods if the first fails
"wasm/wasm_test.wasm" = [
"dlinkwm_print_hello_wasm",    # First try this function
"dlinkwm_call_host_method"      # Then try this function if the first fails
]

# Example configuration for hello_simple.wasm
# Only tries a single entry function
"wasm/hello_simple.wasm" = ["dlinkwm_simple_entry"]

# Example configuration for hello_only.wasm
# Only tries a single entry function
"wasm/hello_only.wasm" = ["dlinkwm_hello_entry"]

# Example configuration for a custom WASM file
# You can add more entries like this for your own WASM files
# "path/to/your/wasm/file.wasm" = ["your_entry_function1", "your_entry_function2"]
